    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">What is Fibromyalgia?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Fibromyalgia is a condition that can make everyday activities feel more challenging, but many people learn gentle ways to manage it and feel better. It's characterized by widespread pain and tenderness that can affect muscles, joints, and soft tissues. You're not alone - millions of people worldwide, mostly women, experience similar symptoms.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Think of it as your nervous system becoming extra sensitive, like having the volume turned up on pain signals. While we don't know exactly why this happens, research suggests it involves a mix of genetic, environmental, and personal factors. The good news is that understanding this can help you find approaches that work for you.
